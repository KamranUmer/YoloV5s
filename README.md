# Dog Detection YoloV5s



This repository contains an implementation of dog image detection using YOLOv5s. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm that achieves high accuracy and speed. In this project, we focus specifically on detecting dogs in images using the YOLOv5s model.

# Dataset
To train and evaluate the YOLOv5s model, we used a custom dataset.

# Model Architecture
The YOLOv5s model is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed for object detection tasks.

# Results
We achieved promising results in dog image detection using the YOLOv5s model. The model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying dogs in various scenarios, including different poses, backgrounds, and scales. We have included some sample images in the results/ directory for reference.


# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the creators of YOLOv5 for providing the open-source implementation and pre-trained models. Their work has been instrumental in enabling efficient and accurate object detection.
